React (Nginx) with Django API (gunicorn)

Aplicação Original:
https://github.com/veryacademy/docker-mastery-with-django

This is a docker compose tutorial we take your first steps creating a deployment setup with React and Django running on a Nginx server, supported with gunicorn for Django. Having already created a basic React and Django application, see the link below for repositories, we first build the docker files needed for both Django and React before then building a docker compose file. This tutorial gives you a better understanding of docker volumes and bind mounts as we look at using both tools. We then build our nginx configuration to serve react from the root directory. Finally we expand the nginx configuration to include a proxy to the Django API.
